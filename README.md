# Web application testing
1. My test plan for "Online Store" application https://demoshopping.ru/. I have developed a test plan for the application based on the work completed in previous modules. The plan was created using the available project description, team structure, and previously developed artifacts such as the checklist, test cases, and defect reports. In preparing the test plan, I also took into account the provided mockups, requirements. These elements were used to assess potential risks and outline the testing strategy for the entire application.
